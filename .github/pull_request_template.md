<!-- ===Instructions===
In the space at the end, enter a short description of the project. The autonomy level (fully autonomous vs. manual intervention) of various categories is shown via emoji. See https://github.com/sgbaird/awesome-self-driving-labs#emoji-key for an emoji key, and see other entries for usage. If you're unsure of some (or all) emoji labels, then use❔; please clarify whether this is because you're unsure if the info is available vs. you're certain the info is *not* there. Either is fine; all contributions are welcome! In the former case, we'll do our best to do the sifting and assign the appropriate label. Some examples:
🧪🔬🏗️💻 means fully autonomous
🧪🔬✖️💻 means fully autonomous, except for sample transfer
🧪🔬❔💻 means fully autonomous, except unsure about sample transfer

Also, manuscript citations follow this general format (volume, issue, and page numbers optional):
[Title](https://doi.org/<doi>). Last, F.; Last, F.; ... ; Last, F. *Journal* YYYY, # (#), #–#.

For example:
[A Self-Driving Laboratory Designed to Accelerate the Discovery of Adhesive Materials](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00029F). Rooney, M. B.; MacLeod, B. P.; Oldford, R.; Thompson, Z. J.; White, K. L.; Tungjunyatham, J.; Stankiewicz, B. J.; Berlinguette, C. P. *Digital Discovery* 2022.
