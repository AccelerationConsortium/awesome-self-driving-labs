Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search [**the main page**](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/awesome-self-driving-labs/blob/main/readme.md) and [**previous suggestions**](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/awesome-self-driving-labs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add your links like: `* [project-name](http://example.com) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* If possible, input the web domain names only, as links to the particular web-pages may expire.
* Make a remark _proprietary_ if the content is not freely available.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

When opening a pull request, enter a short description of the project. The autonomy level (fully autonomous vs. manual intervention) of various categories is shown via emoji. See https://github.com/sgbaird/awesome-self-driving-labs#emoji-key for an emoji key, and see other entries for usage. If you're unsure of some (or all) emoji labels, then use‚ùî; please clarify whether this is because you're unsure if the info is available vs. you're certain the info is *not* there. Either is fine; all contributions are welcome! In the former case, we'll do our best to do the sifting and assign the appropriate label. Some examples:
- üß™üî¨üèóÔ∏èüíª means fully autonomous
- üß™üî¨‚úñÔ∏èüíª means fully autonomous, except for sample transfer
- üß™üî¨‚ùîüíª means fully autonomous, except unsure about sample transfer

Also, manuscript citations follow this general format (volume, issue, and page numbers optional):
> `[Title](https://doi.org/<doi>). Last, F.; Last, F.; ... ; Last, F. *Journal* YYYY, # (#), #‚Äì#.`

For example:
- üß™üî¨üèóÔ∏èüíª | [A Self-Driving Laboratory Designed to Accelerate the Discovery of Adhesive Materials](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00029F). Rooney, M. B.; MacLeod, B. P.; Oldford, R.; Thompson, Z. J.; White, K. L.; Tungjunyatham, J.; Stankiewicz, B. J.; Berlinguette, C. P. *Digital Discovery* 2022.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
